Untitled Hosting: 
Untitled Hosting is the company that I created to do contracting work. 

This site is created using Node.js to serve up the pages with Nginx acting as a reverse proxy. The pages are templated using the JADE Templating engine and developed with the express.js web framework. The data is persisted to a MongoDB NoSQL Database. I'm currently re-writing the application in Angular.js.
